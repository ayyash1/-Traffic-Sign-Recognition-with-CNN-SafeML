This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **Traffic Sign Recognition**, leveraging deep learning for robust and efficient classification.  
By integrating **SafeML**, the model's trustworthiness and safety have been enhanced — ensuring predictions are more reliable even in uncertain or adversarial conditions.

## 📌 Key Features
- **CNN Architecture** tailored for image-based traffic sign classification.
- **SafeML Integration** for safer, interpretable predictions.
- Dataset preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization for better generalization.
- High-accuracy recognition of multiple traffic sign classes.
- End-to-end pipeline from training to evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Safety Layer**: SafeML
- **Tools**: NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Dataset**: [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html)

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy across test data.
- Output includes class predictions with SafeML confidence checks.
- Visualizations of training/validation accuracy & loss curves.
